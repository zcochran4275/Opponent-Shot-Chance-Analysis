# Opponent's Chance Origin Analysis
This project is a main focus of the UCSD Men's Soccer Analytics Team and has real impact on game-time decisions made by coaches.

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze how opponent's create their goal scoring chances 

We can start by looking at the spatial distribution of where opponent's get shots. These chances are most likely to produce goals.

As we can see most shots are around the middle and top of the box. 

Another big aspect of goal scoring chances is the pass before the shot (Shot assist). These are a big indicator of how opponent's are setting up their chances to shoot.

Here we can see a lot of these shot assists are passes coming from wide into and around the middle/top of the box.

Now we want to look into how these opponent's are creating these goal scoring chances.
 - Where their chances are originating
 - How their chances are originating
 - What players are involved in the chance origin

Due to the sensitive nature of this information I have displayed a graph below the contains **randomly generated data** of this nature but demonstrates the visual that would correspond.

The information that you can get out of these plots on the actual data include where a team is struggling and where they should focus on cleaning up mistakes. You can also see which players are giving up the most chances and how/where.

This project is applicable to both post game reports (How did the opponent get chances against UCSD) and scouting reports (How did the opponent get chances against other teams)
